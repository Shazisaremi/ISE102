# Intorduction
Welcome to Module 2 of Introduction to Software Engineering!

In Module 1, you had learnt how to set up the Visual Studio environment to create, store and execute C# programs/projects. In addition to that, you had also implemented your first C# program along with the computer programming concepts.

This module brings to you another set of very important programming fundamental concepts, such as data types, comments and input/output.

# C# Language Basics

## Syntax
C# syntax is inspired by C and C++ syntax. In this section, we describe C#’s elements of syntax, using the following program:
```c#
using System;

class Test
{
  static void Main()
  {
    int x = 12 * 30;
    Console.WriteLine (x);
  }
}
```
